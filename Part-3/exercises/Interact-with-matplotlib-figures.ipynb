    "# Configuring matplotlib figures interactively\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will use IPython's interactive widget functionality to develop tools that can help you to tweak your matplotlib figures. Matplotlib figures have dozens of attributes that can be configured: line styles, colors, markers, fonts, etc.  Here, we will develop a simple tool to configure some of those attributes interactively on an existing figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To carry out this exercise, it will help you to understand how matplotlib is structured internally. In addition to its own [extensive documentation](http://matplotlib.org/contents.html), we have provided as a quick reference a companion notebook called [\"matplotlib, beyond the basics\"](matplotlib_beyond_basics.ipynb) that walks you through how the architecture of matplotlib is assembled.  You may find it useful to refer to it while you work on this exercise.\n",
